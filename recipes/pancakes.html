        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Mom taught me this easy to memorize recipe for pancakes. We always tripled it for our family of seven. </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>white sugar</li>
            <li>baking powder</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Make a well in the center. In a separate bowl, beat together egg, milk and oil. Pour milk mixture into flour mixture. Beat until smooth.</li>
            <li>Pour or scoop the batter onto the hot griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
